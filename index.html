        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <div class="aboutcontain">
            <p class="description">Room 218 is one of the dorm rooms at STEM High School for Boys – 6th of October, originally home to only three students. But over time, this small room became much more than just a dorm. It became the heart of a group of ten students, united by friendship, creativity, and shared experiences. Each member of this group has a unique personality and different interests, from Computer Science, Mathematics, Chemistry, and Physics to Computational Physics, yet they were all brought together by the spirit of Room 218. They chose to call themselves "كيان 218", meaning Entity 218, to represent their unity and strength as one. In Room 218, we stand together through every challenge, supporting one another and growing as a true family. Living in a boarding school and working on capstone projects with these brothers has made our journey not only educational but truly unforgettable.</p>
